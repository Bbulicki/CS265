1.1) The running of code resulted in a segmentation fault.

1.2) No stack is given. 

1.3)
		a)The bug in bug1.c was: The program does not compile.
		  It was fixed by: Passing 'n' by reference.

		b)The bug in bug2.c was: The program does not compile.
		  It was fixed by: using %d for ints and using %f for doubles 
		
		c)The bug in bug3.c was: The numlines was incremented before the first assignment.
		  It was fixed by: Changing the incrementation to after the first assignment.

		d)The bug in avg.c was: The program does not compile.
		  It was fixed by: Passing 'n' by reference.

		e)The bug in driverbug was: The program would return an array with an empty first element.
		  It was fixed by: Adding a randomized pivot to avoid this.

1.4) The compiler can't catch this because the compiler can only can basically only find syntax errors, meanwhile all other errors go unnoticed until the code is run.

1.5) If you use qsort and accidentaly pass the string comparison function the compiler will catch this error for type specific cases, otherwise there will be a runtime error.
